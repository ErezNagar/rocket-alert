    "faq_questions": {
        "q1": "Where are these rockets and UAV's fired from?",
        "a1": "Before the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas\">Hamas</a> attack on <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorangriff_der_Hamas_auf_Israel_2023\">October 7, 2023</a>, rockets were mostly fired from the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip\">Gaza Strip</a>, but since then, rockets and also UAV's (i.e. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loitering_munition\"> loitering munition</a>, more commonly known as <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loitering_munition\">exploding drones</a>) have been fired mostly from South Lebanon, but also from Syria, Iraq and Yemen.",
        "q2": "Who is firing these rockets and UAV's?",
        "a2": "Palestinian terror organizations from Gaza, namely <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas\">Hamas</a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_Islamic_Jihad\">Islamic Jihad</a>, as well as <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hezbollah\">Hezbollah</a> terror organization based in South Lebanon.",
        "q3": "What are these rockets and UAVs targeting?",
        "a3": "Whether fired from Gaza or South Lebanon, these rockets and UAVs are fired indiscriminately at Israeli towns and cities, deliberately targeting innocent civilians, homes and schools.",
        "q4": "Does Israel respond?",
        "a4": "In addition to protecting its civilians via a combination of bomb shelters and the deployment of the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_Dome\">Iron Dome</a> system, Israel typically responds by air striking terror targets, including launch sites, command and control centers, and weapons storage sites.",
        "q5": "What is Iron Dome?",
        "a5": "The <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_Dome\">Iron Dome Aerial Defense System</a> is an Israeli air defense system designed to intercept and destroy rockets whose trajectory would take them to an Israeli populated area.",
        "q6": "Do rockets ever hit Israel?",
        "a6": "Yes. While Iron Dome intercepts most of the rockets fired at Israeli population, rockets still penetrate the defense system and hit residential areas, including homes and schools.",
        "q7": "Where does the alert data come from?",
        "a7": "We use the IDF's <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_Front_Command\">Home Front Command</a> (Pikud HaOref) rocket alert API, which allows us to easily query for real-time rocket alerts. We aggregate the data and slice & dice the information to provide historical data and other insights.",
        "q8": "How reliable is your data?",
        "a8": "The real-time rocket alerts we show are queried directly from the Home Front Command's API, which is connected to the IDF's <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Color\">Red Color</a> early-warning system. The Red Color system is Israel's official source for rocket alerts which millions of Israelis rely on for their safety. A real-time alert would show up on the website immediately after there's an alert going off in Israel. In some cases, and depending on your connection, it might take a few seconds for an alert going off in Israel to show up.",
        "q9": "Does one alert represent a single rocket?",
        "a9": "We only have data on the number of alerts, not on the number of rockets being fired. A single rocket could trigger an alert in multiple locations, depending on the proximity of those locations to each other and the geographical size of those communities. An alert in a specified location typically indicates at least one rocket fired towards that location.",
        "q10": "How can I get more granular data?",
        "a10": "We'd love to help! Feel free to contact us with more information on your specific use case."
